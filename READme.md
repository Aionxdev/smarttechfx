    cd smarttechfx-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` (if provided) or using the structure below. Fill in your specific configurations.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env # if .env.example exists
    ```

    The server will typically start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:5001`).

5.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
